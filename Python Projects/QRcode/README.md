# QR code generator and QR code reader

Before using the generator code (makeqr.py), you need to install the QRcode Library: ```pip install qrcode```</br>
âš  If you get "ImportError: No module named 'Image'" error, you need to install pillow:  ```pip install pillow``` </br></br>
Before using the reader code (readqr.py), you need to install a reader library such as: ```pip install pyzbar ```</br></br>

âš  The reader code only works if your QR code is generated in black!
