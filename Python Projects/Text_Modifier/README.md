# Text Modifier
#### *(Personal Project)*
I wrote this code to convert pdf files to text files, and then edit the specific text files I needed to modify. 

## Pdf to Text
```pdftotext.py``` file converts pdf files, page by page, to a text.txt file. </br>
The code is an adapted version of the code here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/extract-text-from-pdf-file-using-python/ </br>
To use it, first you'll need to ```pip install PyPDF2```. </br>

## Editing the converted text files
*in progress*
