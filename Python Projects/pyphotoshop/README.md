‚ö†Ô∏è You will need to ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` (or use ```pip3``` if you are getting a module not found error). <br/>
‚ö†Ô∏è Update the pip manually if needed, with ``` python -m pip install --upgrade pip```

### In the folder, you will find these files:

```image.py```: contains the Image class that will read and write the images using the PNG Writer and Reader<br/>
```png.py```: pure Python PNG Reader and Writer classes from Johann C. Rocholl<br/>
```transform.py```: implemented image filter functions<br/>
```transform_empty.py```: empty template for image filter functions
