‚ö†Ô∏è You will need to install Numpy by running ```pip install numpy``` first. <br/>
‚ö†Ô∏è Update the pip manually if needed, with ``` python -m pip install --upgrade pip```

### In the folder, you will find these files:

```image.py```: contains the Image class that will read and write the images using the PNG Writer and Reader<br/>
```png.py```: pure Python PNG Reader and Writer classes from Johann C. Rocholl<br/>
```transform_my.py```: implemented image filter functions<br/>
```transform_winp.py```: gets user's inputs and implements the filters accordingly (I created this code.)
